# Marantz-CR511-ethernet-connection

Simply connect to your Marantz amp/receiver via ethernet. 

I'm using my script just to turn ON amplifier when TV is turned ON (it was annoying to push power button everytime). It's universal code and doesn't matter which TV you have, only condition is that ethernet/Wi-Fi connection is disconnected while it's turned OFF.
